A website designed to be a mockup/reworked version of https://www.universitymalltheatres.com/ (before this website was reworked again in 2022).

Both the animation and the logo were are original artworks created by me.

I built this website as my final project for "IT214 - Intro to Web Design as part of IT" program at George Mason University.
